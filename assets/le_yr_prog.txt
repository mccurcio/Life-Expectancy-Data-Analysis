Can you write a python program?
This dataset has 193 countries and 21 features. It has data collected over 15 years.
The dataset is located at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who.
I want a python program that uses groupby country then takes the linear regression of a feature. I want to know if the life expectancy is increasing or decreasing for a country over that 15 year period.


import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# load the data
data = pd.read_csv("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/life-expectancy-who.zip")

# group the data by country
grouped = data.groupby("Country")

# loop through each group (i.e. country)
for name, group in grouped:
    # get the year and life expectancy values for this country
    year = group["Year"].values.reshape(-1, 1)
    life_expectancy = group["Life expectancy "].values.reshape(-1, 1)
    
    # fit a linear regression model
    model = LinearRegression().fit(year, life_expectancy)
    
    # get the slope of the fitted line
    slope = model.coef_[0][0]
    
    # check if the slope is positive (increasing) or negative (decreasing)
    if slope > 0:
        print(f"Life expectancy in {name} is increasing over the 15 year period.")
    else:
        print(f"Life expectancy in {name} is decreasing over the 15 year period.")

---
This program will print out a message indicating whether the life expectancy is increasing or decreasing for each country over the 15 year period.
